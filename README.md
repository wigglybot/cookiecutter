# cookiecutter

Creates a basic component with drone.yml, app, Dockerfile, Pipfile, [...].

Install cookiecutter (`pip install cookiecutter`), then issue `cookiecutter gh:wiglybot/cookiecutter` to create a new component skeleton project. Cookiecutter will ask for a component_name, this will be used as the name for the component's project root directory, and will be used throughout the project as the logger name, dialogue stream subscription name, [...].
